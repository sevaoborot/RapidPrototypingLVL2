# Tamagochi (a Rapid Prototyping course project)

## Introduction

In this repository, you can find the code for my Tamagochi-like mobile game. This was my project for the Rapid Prototyping course at HanzeUAS. During the course, every 2 weeks, I received a theme, which I had to include in my prototype. Here is the theme list and my realization of it: 

  + **Theme 1 - Fantastic**
   
      The main object of the game is a fantastic creature that the player should take care of and check its needs, such as hunger, happiness, health and sleep.
  + **Theme 2 - About You**

      The player can customise the creature by buying different skins in a shop and making its unique appearance.
  + **Theme 3 - The future is Now**

      In the shop, you can find several items refer to the film "Back to the Future"
  + **Theme 4 - Mono**

      There is 2 minigames inside, that refer to this theme:
     + *Minigame001: The player should define one square, which has a different color, within a given time.*
     + *Minigame002: The player should color the grid field in one color within a given time.*

## TODO

I am planning to continue working on this project later. Here is several ideas about what I should work on in the future: 

  + Adding UI animations via DoTween 
  + Improve the needs system and add a behaviour tree for the creature. The creature's condition will cause different creature behaviour. 
  + More skins and minigames!
